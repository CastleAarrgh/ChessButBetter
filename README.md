# Straight Outta Compsci
Sam Lubelsky, Jason Xia

Itâ€™s Chess, the 1500-year-old open  pvp strategy game, but with additional variants and features attached that make it objectively better and cooler. These will range from being fairly small changes that are easy to implement to larger overhauls of the game that will require a greater work investment, such as alternate game variations.

Note: Tracy Zhang is Jason's mom, and the branch labeled with that name is actually Jason writing code because it is her windows account Jason is using.
